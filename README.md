## Instructions

In this classic arcade game, your goal is to move your player from the starting position (bottom left hand side of the board) — using the up, down, right,left arrow keys on your keyboard — to the finish line (top of the screen where the water is) without colliding with the bug enemies!

1. Use the arrows (up, down, left, right) to move your player.

2. If you collide with an enemy, your Collision score will increase by 1 and your player will be returned to the starting position (bottom left hand corner).

3. If you make it to the water at the top without colliding with an enemy, your Wins score will be increased by 1 and your player will be returned to the starting position (bottom left hand corner).

4. To restart the game & score totals, press the reset button.

5. You can choose your player icon from the dropdown menu. IMPORTANT : Once you have chosen it, be sure to click on the board afterwards, otherwise you won’t be able to move on the board with your arrows.

6. TODO : Add Gem rewards. Add difficulty levels. Figure out how to move focus to canvas once player is chosen from Dropdown menu.
